## Inspiration
There has been steady increase in Gun Violence over the past decade and it continues to rapidly increase . 30,000 women, men & children are killed in America every year by guns which means almost 100 people every day. Data scientists and statisticians can help analyze this dire situation by studying gun violence data and make informed predictions about future trends in order to build strategies that will eventually minimize , control gun violence and promote gun safety.

## Data Source
Kaggle.com is the Data source for this project. We chose a dataset named “Gun Violence Data” (https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data). This dataset contains more than 260k gun violence incidents, in the US between January 2013 and March 2018 , with detailed information about each incident, in CSV format.

## Questions-
- What’s the trend of gun violence in US? 
- Is it decreasing on increasing over the years? 
- Which states has highest % of mass shootings?
- What type of gun shootings are occurring most?

## Skills Used:
Python, Postgres SQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Plotly.js, Leaflet.js, Flask, Jupyter Notebook

## Summary Findings-
- The result of our analysis showed that east coast had highest number of gun shooting incidents from year 2013 till 2018
- In year 2019 - California had the highest mass shootings incidents which is 45 followed by, Illinois 38 and Texas 29.  
 The number of mass shootings across the US thus far in 2019 has outpaced the number of days this year.  Before this year has even ended, 2019 has already had more mass shootings than any year since 2014.  As of December 1st, which is the 335th day of the year, there have been 385 mass shootings in U.S
- It has found that home invasion and unintentional shootings are the types of  gun shootings that are occurring most in united states, as compared to other shooting types like defensive usage, murders/suicide and mass shootings. So, based on the study, the gun shootings related to home invasion were about 35% of yearly gun shootings, followed by unintentional shootings then defensive use and then murder suicides, and then mass shootings.
